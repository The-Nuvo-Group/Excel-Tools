### ABOUT
SAT is an **Excel Macro** that structures Worksheets for ***Pretty Printing***.

It runs on a user interface upon which it loads pre-existent   configuration files that determine the settings to apply.

It helps by adjusting column widths automatically based on the scale(zoom) provided on the config file and the respective data of each column.
